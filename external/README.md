## [Windows] Develop bind to DLL

This operation is **only for developers**. Binding file `functions_windows.go` is generated by `mksyscall_windows.go`.

Required:

- [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)

```bash
$ cd external
$ go generate  # functions_windows.go will be created
```

`functions_windows.go` is fixed some code after generated to fit for Menoh DLL. Please see `external\converter\win_converter.go` more detail.
